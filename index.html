<br>I am currently a third-year undergraduate student at <a href="https://pes.edu/">PES University</a>, Bangalore, 
pursuing a major in Computer Science. My research interests lie at the intersection of 
<b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b>, with a particular emphasis on 
<b>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</b>, <b>Knowledge Graphs</b>, <b>Reinforcement Learning (RL)</b>, 
and <b>Large Language Models (LLMs)</b>.<br><br>

I will be joining the <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">University of California, Berkeley</a> as a 
<b>Research Intern</b> during the summer of 2025, where I will conduct research under the mentorship of 
<a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~prasad/">Professor Prasad Raghavendra</a>.<br><br>

Previously, I served as a <b>Machine Learning Research Intern</b> at the 
<a href="https://www.pes.edu/cdsaml/">Center for Data Sciences and Applied Machine Learning 
	(CDSAML)</a> at PES University, where I focused on optimizing
<b>aspect-based sentiment analysis</b> through the application of <b>hypergraph-based techniques</b>.<br><br>

My bachelor thesis is on Vision Language Models where I am supervised by Dr. Surabhi Narayan. <br><br>
