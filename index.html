I am a third-year Computer Science undergraduate at <a href="https://pes.edu/">PES University</a>, 
Bangalore, with research interests in <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b>,
 with a particular focus on <b>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</b>, <b>Knowledge Graphs</b>, and 
 <b>Reinforcement Learning (RL)</b>.<br><br>

In the summer of 2025, I will be joining the <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">University of California, Berkeley</a>
 as a Research Intern, working under Professor <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~prasad/">Prasad Raghavendra</a>. 
 Previously, I interned at the <a href="https://www.pes.edu/cdsaml/">Center for Data Sciences and Applied Machine
	 Learning (CDSAML)</a> at PES University, where I focused on improving aspect-based sentiment analysis using
	  hypergraph-based techniques.<br><br>

My bachelor's thesis, supervised by Dr. Surabhi Narayan, focuses on Vision-Language Models.<br><br>

I’m always excited to collaborate on interesting research projects—feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or work together!
